One suggestion I want to add  I have received accessories while unboxing charger, Headphones, Phone Cover &amp; off course Oppo F11 Pro my phone but one thing which might be in the box it's Tampered Glass guard.which is missing. if it includes the Tampered glass guard too then it's a great product.....I will give 5 star to this product if I found tempered glass guard. Overall I satisfied with the package.</span>

The 16 MP Front Camera Is Very Powerful Camera ... And The Night Mode Of the Back Camera is The Best for low Light Photograpy..<br>2. The 4000mah Battery Is Long Lasting...<br>And The VOOC 3.0 is very fast Just 0 to 100% charge Is in 50 min ...The Charging is super No Need of Type C Charger...<br>3. Face recognition is very fast in it's quality.<br>4. Display is Very Bright And The Design Is Very Sexy Design Because Of It's 3 color..<br>5. The Phone Is Very Fast and the best thing is OPPO GAME SPACE ... which booster your gaming performance...<br>If U Are confused to buy OPPO F11 PRO OR VIVO V15 PRO .. Then I should go for OPPO f11 pro ...</span>

Undoubtedly one of the best selfie camera.<br><br>Fingerprint reader is very poor , face recognition also. Some cheap quality material in a high end Phone. Highly unsatisfied with the phone, waste of money.</span>

"<span data-hook=""review-body"" class=""a-size-base review-text review-text-content""><span class="""">If you are looking for a phone in range of 20k,then oppo f11 pro will satisfy you more than any other mobile. The rising camera is an added beauty for this mobile which is really stunning in both looks and taking pictures. Battery capacity and stand by time is far better. The notch less display will help you view vidoes with more comfort and negligible interference. The vooc charger provided also works well. We have many mobiles with distinct or same features as this mobile has with a higher price, but apart from all of these OPPO F11 PRO do satisfy you in an affordable price. Thank you OPPO (The Official Indian Cricket Team Sponsor).</span>

The pop-up camera technology is too good to see. Its fast and works quietly.</span>

"<span data-hook=""review-body"" class=""a-size-base review-text review-text-content""><span class="""">1st of all thank you Amazon for your quuck delivery service. Oppo f11 pro is a very gd phone. Camera is excellent in day &amp; low light. Battery quality is very good. Storage is the only issue in this phone, at the price of 25k oppo only provides 64gb rom &amp; 2nd sim slot is hybrid. Processor should be little bit better at this range. I played pubg without any problem. Smooth as butter. If you get it in any offer which i get in a no cost emi the amount is only 17k with exchanging my 3yrs old phone. Which is a great deal for me. Go for it if u like to click great selfies &amp; photos. Gaming is very good in this phone.</span>

It took only 1 hour to charge from 0 to 90%. Face recognition is excellent.  Screen quality and its durability are quite respectable. Any how the more you  ready to pay, the more premium features you can avail. Overall I am completely satisfied with this product.</span>

Heating issue when surfing the Internet and video call .<br>2. Back Panel is Easily Scratch-able, Even Dust particle create a big scratch easily. So please cover the back panel through scratch resistance guard.<br>3.  Screen is very good but if oppo provide Amoled panel , it was a super deal for his true followers.<br>4.  Finger print photography  not include in colors os 6 . It is Basic feature for any mobile, Please update this feature in next update.<br>5. Back cover which is provide in the Box is very cheap quality, it is not a dust resistance, Dust particle is always on the back cover. and color is very dull , The beauty of the phone is cover from this cover.<br>6. you tube notification is not clear from pop up window.<br>Pros:-<br>1. Night photo-graphy  is ver good in this phone, Night Mode is very good from other device which is in the market.<br>2.

Sadly opportunity has gone with a micro USB slot for charging, at this price point we expect a type C port. It supports VOOC fast charge so it's good.<br><br>A great smartphone at this price. The cameras are just amazing and the photos are good and clear, but the low light photography could be improved.<br><br>It has a very powerful processor the Helios p70, great for multi-tasking gaming and normal usage. It has 6 gigs of ram, which is enough for 2019 and is also somewhat futureproof<br><br>It runs on colour OS 6 based on Android pie which is fast responsive and optimised. And you also get a game space feature which can be use to boost gaming performance and block calls or notifications<br><br>Talking about the storage, it has 64 gigs of storage. It's okay but, they should have gone with 128 gigs instead.<br><br>Overall it's a great phone with some flaws like micro USB.<br><br>.</span>

The camera is simply awesome, takes great pictures and in absolute darkness you can turn on the Light feature which is awesome.<br><br>The Fingerprint and Face recognition is very impressive as its very quick and responsive.<br><br>There are many other features you can turn on like when you phone is locked just make an 'O' to turn the camera on or making a 'V' to turn the flashlight on. This is very handy when you quickly need a light or get your Camera on without really having the need to unlock your phone.<br><br>I am glad I bought the OPPO F11 Pro. Very Happy with the Purchase.<br><br>It's only been a week and I am still exploring.<br><br>Cheers</span>

"<span data-hook=""review-body"" class=""a-size-base review-text review-text-content""><span class="""">Oppo has done a super fine job with this one! It has an amazing screen to body ratio, brilliant battery and awesome cameras. The most iconic feature is obviously the front pop up camera tech. Its super cool to use it, especially for face unlock. The Color OS feels smooth and easy to operate. I got a security patch of May within 15 mins of switching it on. The build quality is fantastic. The Aurora Green is way more good looking than the black variant. You will love the performance of Mediatek's P70. I know it cant be compared with Snapdragon ones but why should we? P70 is way more powerful than SD 660 and has better benchmark scores than SD 675. This processor effortlessly manages the image processing and gives you super fast results from the 48 mp back camera. Never underestimate Mediatek anymore! Use the F11 Pro and feel the power yourself.</span>

"<span data-hook=""review-body"" class=""a-size-base review-text review-text-content""><span class="""">Looks and design is the 1st thing that caught my eyes, Aurora Green colour is a very beautiful shade; looks appealing to eyes- subtle yet gorgeous. Then I liked every aspect of this phone. Only thing I didn't like is that the back side of the phone is getting so many fingerprint marks if u don't use the phone with clean hands. So I could see many fingerprint marks on the back side, so need to clean it everyday. Whereas in a Fon with glass back like Huawei and Redmi note 7, 7pro it looks all clean everytime, marks,impressions don't show up much.<br>But this not a very big disadvantage. It will rarely bother anyone. I just felt to include this point. I would rate this phone 8.5/10<br>Coz it's a little bit heavy than other competitors. Otherwise I have just fallen in love with this phone 😍🥰 Definitely go for it.</span>

Facelock is not easy with pop-up cameras. More than that while camera going back it makes a knock sound. I checked it with Oppo authorized service center,the said it may due to dust they cleaned and given it back I checked at that time. Hope it is cleared. But next day onwards it started again....

review
"<span data-hook=""review-body"" class=""a-size-base review-text review-text-content""><span class="""">Good camera takes very detailed pictures. No type c port charger but charges very quickly and lost longer. Processing speed is good enough for daily or rough usage. Played pubg on this device with HD graphics with high frame rate for 2 and a half hours and I didn't face any lag hardly faced any frame drop. Gameplay was smooth. While playing pubg, mobile is not getting heated up much and battery also only less than 40 percent consumed for the two and a half hours game play with HD graphics.  Overall good phone at this price. Would recommend it.</span>

But still there pop camera and sensors making it good, also you never disappointed with there features. And there fast charging work really well. Camera is also fantastic.<br>100% recommended</span>

"<span data-hook=""review-body"" class=""a-size-base review-text review-text-content""><span class="""">But some point to be noted # Oppo India :-<br>Cons:-<br>1. Heating issue when surfing the Internet and video call .<br>2. Back Panel is Easily Scratch-able, Even Dust particle create a big scratch easily. So please cover the back panel through scratch resistance guard.<br>3.  Screen is very good but if oppo provide Amoled panel , it was a super deal for his true followers.<br>4.  Finger print photography  not include in colors os 6 . It is Basic feature for any mobile, Please update this feature in next update.<br>5. Back cover which is provide in the Box is very cheap quality, it is not a dust resistance, Dust particle is always on the back cover. and color is very dull , The beauty of the phone is cover from this cover.<br>6. you tube notification is not clear from pop up window.<br>Pros:-<br>1. Night photo-graphy  is ver good in this phone, Night Mode is very good from other device which is in the market.<br>2. Full screen &amp; bezel less display is Trendy and future of the Mobile industry.<br>3. pop- up camera is very good to see and  pic is super.<br>4. 48 mp camera is good but if F11 pro use Sony sensor , this phone was one step upper compare to other market.<br>5. Back Design is superb , it is very good compare to vivo.<br>6. pop up camera position is very good to see and very pleasant to eyes.<br>7. fast charging is very fast, vooc is a racket.<br><br>Overall phone is very good with latest phenomena  of mobile industry.<br>And I think Heating issue  will be solved in future through Software Update.<br><br>Thanks</span>

Sadly opportunity has gone with a micro USB slot for charging, at this price point we expect a type C port. It supports VOOC fast charge so it's good.<br><br>A great smartphone at this price. The cameras are just amazing and the photos are good and clear, but the low light photography could be improved.<br><br>It has a very powerful processor the Helios p70, great for multi-tasking gaming and normal usage. It has 6 gigs of ram, which is enough for 2019 and is also somewhat futureproof<br><br>It runs on colour OS 6 based on Android pie which is fast responsive and optimised. And you also get a game space feature which can be use to boost gaming performance and block calls or notifications<br><br>Talking about the storage, it has 64 gigs of storage. It's okay but, they should have gone with 128 gigs instead.<br><br>Overall it's a great phone with some flaws like micro USB.<br><br>.</span>

"<span data-hook=""review-body"" class=""a-size-base review-text review-text-content""><span class="""">This is My first time writing a review on any product, my apologies for any mistakes or missing something in the review.<br><br>I was using the Vivo V9 for almost 9 months and something did not add quiet well. Most of the time the Phone was not going what its supposed to do with the configuration it had. I was planning for an upgrade, POCO F1 , Vivo V15pro or Oppo F11 pro. These were the phones that I considered to go for...<br><br>After a lot of comparisons and considerations I ordered the F11 pro. Phone's first impression itself was awesome😍. The Thunder black color is superb. Though the phone's body is of Plastic, you will never feel the same. The glossy finish and mirror like back panel will give you guys a rich feel ( both the back panel and touch panel will welcome a lot of fingerprints and smudge).<br><br>ColorOS 6 based on the latest Android version 9 runs smoothly with the 6gigs RAM. I guarantee you guys, you are not going to feel any Kinda lag while using this beautyful beast.<br><br>4000mAh battery holds great with the daily usage and Gives you guys an ample hours of backup while you watch online movies or play any games ( so far I've played PUBG, NFS underground, Asphalt 9 and COD without any issues and I've enjoyed the gaming experience this phone can offer)<br><br>Coming to the camera point of view, F11 pro is equipped with 48mp+5mp dual camera in the back and a 16mp Pop-up Selfie unit. I am not a selfie freak so I can only tell you guys the front shooter does good job. You can customize the Pop-up camera sound (popup and popdown sound) through the setting and the sound out of this world(something like an 👽). The dual camera setup in the back will help you guys to capture pretty decent shoots in the day light and low light scenarios but night shoots are not much impressive. ( Added some pics)<br><br>Phone is So quick interms of both face unlock as well as finger.<br><br>Speaker quality is good and loud ( not too much)<br>Earpiece produce decent amount of volume but sometimes I felt like it's auditable even if the Speaker phone is not enabled.<br><br>With that being said, if you guys are looking for a phone which can handle heavy gaming and take awesome pictures and not wanted to be bothered with any notches you guys can go for this beautiful beast.</span>

"<span data-hook=""review-body"" class=""a-size-base review-text review-text-content""><span class="""">Happy with usage, battery and performance. My performance includes WhatsApp and Surfing Mainly. For other things, I have iPhone X. However not happy with the back. The back is slippery and I thought it would be metal. They said its a glass but it all feels Plastic. Using phone since 3 weeks, there are already back scratches from normal office usage. I usually plan to use phone without cover. Heck what is the fun of 3 color gradient if one has to use cover. The cover they have provided gives pretty cheap feeling and it gets all oily maybe because of Delhi Summer. I would had been satisfied if this was sub 15k phone but when spending around 24k, I expect premium metallic feeling. Maybe they spent all money on no-notch screen maybe that is why other things were compromised including the processor. ..<br><br>I would love to sell this phone if anyone want to purchase and buy something else. Coming from Redmi Note 5 Pro 6GB ... Metal feeling is totally missing</span>

The notch less display will help you view vidoes with more comfort and negligible interference. The vooc charger provided also works well.

"<span data-hook=""review-body"" class=""a-size-base review-text review-text-content""><span class="""">Good camera takes very detailed pictures. No type c port charger but charges very quickly and lost longer. Processing speed is good enough for daily or rough usage. Played pubg on this device with HD graphics with high frame rate for 2 and a half hours and I didn't face any lag hardly faced any frame drop. Gameplay was smooth. While playing pubg, mobile is not getting heated up much and battery also only less than 40 percent consumed for the two and a half hours game play with HD graphics.  Overall good phone at this price. Would recommend it.</span>

"<span data-hook=""review-body"" class=""a-size-base review-text review-text-content""><span class="""">But some point to be noted # Oppo India :-<br>Cons:-<br>1. Heating issue when surfing the Internet and video call .<br>2. Back Panel is Easily Scratch-able, Even Dust particle create a big scratch easily. So please cover the back panel through scratch resistance guard.<br>3.  Screen is very good but if oppo provide Amoled panel , it was a super deal for his true followers.<br>4.  Finger print photography  not include in colors os 6 . It is Basic feature for any mobile, Please update this feature in next update.<br>5. Back cover which is provide in the Box is very cheap quality, it is not a dust resistance, Dust particle is always on the back cover. and color is very dull , The beauty of the phone is cover from this cover.<br>6. you tube notification is not clear from pop up window.<br>Pros:-<br>1. Night photo-graphy  is ver good in this phone, Night Mode is very good from other device which is in the market.<br>2. Full screen &amp; bezel less display is Trendy and future of the Mobile industry.<br>3. pop- up camera is very good to see and  pic is super.<br>4. 48 mp camera is good but if F11 pro use Sony sensor , this phone was one step upper compare to other market.<br>5. Back Design is superb , it is very good compare to vivo.<br>6. pop up camera position is very good to see and very pleasant to eyes.<br>7. fast charging is very fast, vooc is a racket.<br><br>Overall phone is very good with latest phenomena  of mobile industry.<br>And I think Heating issue  will be solved in future through Software Update.<br><br>Thanks</span>

We also get a silicon case for the phone, so that's good<br><br>It has a hybrid SIM slot which means you can add 2 SIM card or 1 SIM+1 SD card. Sadly opportunity has gone with a micro USB slot for charging, at this price point we expect a type C port. It supports VOOC fast charge so it's good.<br><br>A great smartphone at this price. The cameras are just amazing and the photos are good and clear, but the low light photography could be improved.<br><br>It has a very powerful processor the Helios p70, great for multi-tasking gaming and normal usage. It has 6 gigs of ram, which is enough for 2019 and is also somewhat futureproof<br><br>It runs on colour OS 6 based on Android pie which is fast responsive and optimised. And you also get a game space feature which can be use to boost gaming performance and block calls or notifications<br><br>Talking about the storage, it has 64 gigs of storage. It's okay but, they should have gone with 128 gigs instead.<br><br>Overall it's a great phone with some flaws like micro USB.<br><br>.</span>

Processor should be little bit better at this range. I played pubg without any problem. Smooth as butter. If you get it in any offer which i get in a no cost emi the amount is only 17k with exchanging my 3yrs old phone. Which is a great deal for me.
